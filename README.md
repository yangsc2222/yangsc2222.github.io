## STUDIES OF HUMANITIES IN CHINA
**About**    
As I and my friends feel, many foreigners want konw the studies of humanities in China, but most studies are written in Chinese, it is very hard for the communication. So, I and my friends would like to introduce the studies of  philosophy, argumentation, fallacy, rhetoric,pragmatic, linguistic, culture, history and some other humanities in China in these years to the world. If you want know something about my country, you can tell us by email, we would like to build some more pages fot them. If you want write some topics, just give us email, we are very happy for that.
